Building a MLP Neural Network from scratch, using only numpy. My main goal is to reduce the degree of "black-box" understanding with NNs, specifically back-propogation 

NOTE: Still need to add testing for accuracy

To run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run ```python testingEnvironment.py```

Thoughts on the network:
You can read my detailed thoughts here: [Notion Page](https://scarlet-uranium-4df.notion.site/infancy-a-neural-net-from-scratch-80263381d0654c2c99e33c2c2eae582e?pvs=4)

The following is a visualization of the forward propogation alg for each layer, but note that the activation functions might change
